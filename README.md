# üí´ About Me:
Hello, I‚Äôm Oleg Rovinskiy, <br>a passionate and experienced Full Stack Developer with a robust background in end-to-end software application development.  
  
I bring a strong combination of skills in design, development, testing, and deployment, complemented by a focus on automation. Throughout my career, 
I have consistently delivered solutions that streamline workflows, improve efficiency, and enhance user experiences, saving valuable time and resources. 
I thrive in environments where I can collaborate with engineers and stakeholders to gather requirements, define specifications, and deliver high-quality 
software.<br>  
  
In my recent role I made significant contributions by integrating a data collection microservice into an internal application, 
preparing the organization for future machine learning initiatives and greatly reducing manual data processing efforts. 
My ongoing projects include developing a brain tumor detection system and central applications for data processing and machine learning (ML) assistance.<br>  
  
I led a team in handling maintenance, upgrades, and release cycles. I played a key role in revamping 
.NET web pages into MVC Razor Pages, achieving a 40% improvement in efficiency and team productivity. 
My efforts also included enhancing search engine functionalities with suggestion flyouts and popular results filtering, along with delivering out-of-cycle 
hot fixes and urgent features to resolve critical issues swiftly.<br>  
  
I leveraged my skills as a QA Software Automation Engineer, where I developed a robust 
testing process for back-end data validation in a CI/CD environment. By automating UI testing with Selenium, Playwright, Python, Git runners, NUnit, and .NET, 
I helped reduce manual testing time by 30 hours per project. Additionally, I created test scripts that validated application functionalities following system changes, 
insuring the software maintained high standards of reliability and performance.<br>  
  
I'm actively expanding my skill set in the realm of machine learning 
and artificial intelligence. My current focus includes studying TensorFlow and PyTorch to enhance my understanding of ML models and deep learning frameworks. 
I'm particularly interested in applying these skills to real-world problems, such as image recognition and predictive analytics, which align with the projects 
I'm currently working on. This ongoing learning journey reflects my commitment to staying updated with emerging technologies and continually evolving as a software engineer.<br><br>
